    "   The game is based on Harry Potter book series, in particular the 4th book of the series Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire by J.K. Rowling. The purpose of the game is to find a way through the labyrinth to reach the Goblet and win the Triwizard Tournament. There is only one win function game_win at the end of the game, but wrong choices call for the game_over function which appears in the game quite often and results in failing to accomplish the task for the player. In order to win the game, the player has to make the right choices to reach the final stage of the game. The player is a fifth-year Slytherin student at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry and has been chosen to represent the school in the tournament.\n",
    "\n",
    "   It has been assumed that the player has successfully accomplished the two previous tasks and for the last challenge, he or she needs to find their way through the labyrinth to find the Goblet of Fire and win the competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "   The bug that has not been solved yet is creating within the code a counter that would take one attempt from the player's life-counter whenever they take a wrong path. When I add it to the code, the while loop stops working as I want, and I don't understand how to bring things back to normal. Instead, I end the game with the variable game_over that I declare every time the player takes a wrong path. Using a counter would save a lot of work by doing it automatically.\"\n",
